Progress:


I have encoded Density Clustering ML Model, selected with DBCV analysis suite to identify coexistence among competing species contrary to existing principles of competitive exclusion. 

I am currently working on a paper in which I am developing an R package for Unsupervised ML Biological Trait Density Clustering using a recent clustering algorithm from 2018 research and a Density Based Cross Validatiion metric from 2016 research

I'm constructing an R package for Ecologists to identify clustering in ecological trait data through Unsupervised Machine Learning classifiers  [R, Python, C++, MATLAB].  I utilize (DBSCAN, K-medoids, KNN) informed with a suite of validation methods. Research is done with the University of Michigan Computational Ecology, Evolution, and Biology. [R, Python, C++, MATLAB]
