Progress:

Encoded Density Clustering ML Model, selected with DBCV analysis suite to identify coexistence among competing species contrary to existing principles of competitive exclusion. Model architecture and validation designed from recent ML research.

I'm currently constructing an R package for Ecologists to identify clustering in ecological trait data through Unsupervised Machine Learning classifiers  [R, Python, C++, MATLAB].  I utilize (DBSCAN, K-medoids, KNN) informed with a suite of validation methods. Research is done with the University of Michigan Computational Ecology, Evolution, and Biology. [R, Python, C++, MATLAB]
