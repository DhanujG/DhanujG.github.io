I am entering my final year at the University of Michigan graduating with degrees in Data Science, Computer Science, and Ecology. I am more than excited about for the future! My background and pursued interests in the multidisciplinary applications of recent Machine Learning research and Big Data Analysis give me great confidence to approach modern AI and Autonomous Technology Opportunities.

I am an upcoming senior at the University of Michigan, with two of my three degrees being Data Science and Computer Science. Given the cancellation of my summer career plans, my search for new opportunities led me to discover the Research Intern position at Google. I was not only attracted to Google's approach to team-based discovery with software engineers but also how relevant my work in machine learning and data analytics research is to the position. Given my experiences and philosophy applying data science techniques to multiple domains coupled with my history of multidisciplinary teamwork and communication, I believe I am an excellent fit for your team as a Research Intern.
	 My passion for exploring how the intersection of data science contributes to propagating growth within any field has driven my personal and professional pursuits. I am equally excited about the unique journey as I am with the destination. In my recent personal project, I explored utilizing machine learning to prevent forest fires by detecting tree density. I implemented a spatial convolutional neural network to estimate density maps from aerial drone images of forests, performing at 83% test accuracy. However, what I believe truly distinguishes me as a candidate is my ever-growing dedication to acquire the most reliable basis of knowledge for my projects such that I can uniquely apply data science with the highest of potential. My search for technical information and inspiration has led me to pursue degrees in Data Science and Computer Science, consisting of even graduate classes. My work of applying data science within medical research had me implement data-driven ML classifiers to predict the stage of Bladder Cancer with ~80% staging accuracy. My commitment to additionally understand the field of cancer staging, allowed me to efficiently work with Radiologists, Oncologists, and Medical Researchers to become published twice as the primary author. 
 My affinity and experiences with interdisciplinary communication contribute significantly to my accomplishments. At an SPIE Conference, I presented my data-driven cancer research to a hall of 50+ doctors, engineers, and health officials, answering a spectrum of questions from top scientists and resulting in the successful publication of our work. The skills I have picked up from my history in teaching, combined with my enthusiasm and commitment to obtain multiple perspectives, has been crucial to my team and leadership efficacy. In my Computational Ecology Lab meeting, I often operate as a liaison, explaining techniques of data science and their ecological relevance/potential to my colleagues. I work with a team of ecologists, biologists, and mathematicians in my current research utilizing unsupervised clustering analysis to obtain patterns in field species trait data. 
 As Founder and Project Manager in Michigan Eco Data, I have led multidisciplinary applications of data science and facilitated communication across a team that ranges from earth science to computer science majors. In our most recent project, I took over 3 MM+ EPA datapoints utilizing data visualization and structuring techniques to produce a tool for average consumers to see a heatmap of chemical contaminations in their zip code. This work earned our organization sponsorship with the Michigan Institute for Data Science â€“ the premier governing body for data-driven work at the University.
I believe that my technical experiences supported by my evolving basis of knowledge, along with the team and leadership experiences built with my interdisciplinary communication, make me an ideal candidate as a Machine Learning and Data Analytics Research Intern.
