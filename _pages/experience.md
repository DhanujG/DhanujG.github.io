RXA: AI & BI Consulting 
-----
* [Website](https://www.rxa.io/services/ai-bi-consulting)
* January 2021 – Present
  * 	Developed Gradient Boosted ML Model on custom dataflow in DOMO [SQL, Python] structuring 60,000+ sales records optimizing client automotive acquisition for maximizing expected profit margin with 96% accuracy
  *	Created API [Python, Google Cloud API] to aggregate and structure ~4GB historic client sales CSV data from drive repository for 100+ files with full client encryption and recurring database updates saving ~30+ hrs. data entry
  * Implemented ML hierarchical clustering model [Python, R, AWS Sagemaker] on client’s insurance case data with AUROC of 0.88 thus identifying 7 key consumer risk factors potentially increasing policy profit margins 30%


Machine Learning Dev. Student Research

Computational Ecology, Evolution and Biology Lab - University of Michigan 
-----
* [Lab Website](https://sites.google.com/umich.edu/ostlinglab/people?authuser=0)
* January 2020 – Present
  * Published open-source R package titled weightedClustSuite [R, C++, Python] for Machine Learning Density Clustering  & Validation, used on weighted species abundance data enabling identification of species distribution clusters [Link](https://github.com/DhanujG/weightedClustSuite)
  * Applied weighted Species Trait Data to 2014 ML Research in Density Peak Clustering demonstrating contrary coexistence of similar niched species despite competitive exclusion with promising clustering validation (DBI: 0.56)
  * Operate as an interdisciplinary reference within lab to explain and analyze machine learning and data analysis research.
