Data Science Intern
=====
GHD: Engineering, Architectural, and Environmental Consulting
-----
* [Company Website](https://www.ghd.com/en-us/expertise/spatial-sciences.aspx)
* June 2019 – August 2019
  * Structured collected/ scraped ARCGIS with facility data and performed regression and linear neural network analysis to determine optimal PFAS testing sites with reduction in operating costs. 
  * Created custom field forms and designed database architecture to pipeline response data into auto-populated EPA Audit Forms. Automation pipeline transformed field form collection data into 5000+ Audit cells previously filled manually.
  * Notable Technologies Used: ARCGIS, ARCGIS External API, SAP-HANA, Python, Survey123, FME, MS Excel


Machine Learning & Computer Vision Student Research
=====
Michigan Medicine Computer Aided Diagnosis Laboratory - University of Michigan
-----
* [Lab Website](https://cad-ai.med.umich.edu/people)
* January 2017 – May 2019
  * Findings resulted as Primary Author in two Publications, was selected for Poster, Oral Presentation in [SPIE Conference](https://spie.org/conferences-and-exhibitions?SSO=1) 2019
  * Performed Feature Extraction and Selection on Bladder CTU Scan Segmentations to extract key features in Bladder Cancer Lesion Staging (staging determines the avenue of treatment)
  * Implemented and trained a series of Back Propagated Neural Networks, Linear Discriminant Analysis, Support Vector Machines, and Random Forest Algorithms – validated through ROC analysis - resulting in a models' cancer staging accuracy (+80%)
