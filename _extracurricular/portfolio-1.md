Project Director & Founder
-----
I founded Michigan Eco Data as a venue for interdisciplinary exploration in data science, software engineering, and environmental conservation. We are a sponsored Student Organization under Michigan Institute for Data Science (MIDAS). Our execution of consumer Michigan Chemical Contamination Heatmap Visualization for Consumer Use (project details below) and effective executive board management awarded our organization the 2000$ sponsorship per semester from MIDAS. We currently have 40 active members!
