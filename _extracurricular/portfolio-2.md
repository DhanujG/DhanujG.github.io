The DJs are a fun-loving, goofy, diverse group of students, and while all our members come from different sides of campus, we share the same intense passion for making music! We just recently placed 1st at ICCA Midwest Quarterfinal and I have personally been awarded Outstanding Vocal Percussionist. as Business Manager, I implemented outreach techniques and initiation of new fundraising events to end with a 25% increase in revenue. We are currently producing an album!
